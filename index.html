    <h1> Swimming Poem  </h1>
    <p>
    In the crystal clear waters, I dive and play, <br>
With each stroke of my fins, I dance away.<br>
The ripples on the surface, they shimmer and glow, <br>
As I swim deeper, the world below.<br>

The ocean's depths, so vast and blue,<br>
A treasure trove of secrets, waiting for you.<br>
Schools of fish, they dart and weave,<br>
Their scales shining bright, like diamonds in the wave.<br>

The coral reefs, a colorful sight,<br>
Teeming with life, both day and night.<br>
Sea turtles glide, with graceful ease,<br>
Through the currents, they find their peace.<br>   </html>
